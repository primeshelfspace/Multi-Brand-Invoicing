/**
 * Reading the nonce here (not just setting it in middleware) is the other
 * half of the CSP contract in middleware.ts: Next only threads a nonce onto
 * its own generated script tags — the inline bootstrap script hydration
 * itself depends on — when a Server Component up the tree actually calls
 * `headers()` to read it. Skipped, `'strict-dynamic'` still applies (which
 * makes browsers ignore the `'self'` fallback), so those scripts end up with
 * no valid nonce at all: CSP silently blocks them, React never hydrates, and
 * every button on every page becomes inert with no visible error.
