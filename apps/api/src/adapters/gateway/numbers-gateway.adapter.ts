/**
 * NumbersGatewayAdapter — BLOCKED ON DEP-01.
 *
 * TDD-001 §10.3 records why: docs.numbersgateway.com resolves but returns no
 * readable content unauthenticated, and /api/v2 returns 404. The contract could
 * not be read, so this adapter cannot be written honestly yet.
 *
 * It exists as a typed placeholder on purpose. Because the domain depends on
 * PaymentGatewayPort and not on this class, invoicing, calculation, state
 * transitions and their tests are all buildable against FakeGateway while the
 * contract is obtained. Only this file is blocked.
 *
 * QUESTIONS THAT MUST BE ANSWERED BEFORE IMPLEMENTING
 *   1. Auth model — API key, OAuth client credentials, or signed request?
 *   2. Is there a hosted card-entry component that keeps us in SAQ A scope, or
 *      does the card PAN touch our origin? This decides PCI scope, not styling.
 *   3. Idempotency — is there a request-level idempotency key, and how long is
 *      it honoured?
 *   4. Webhooks — signature scheme, replay window, delivery ordering guarantees
 *      (we assume none), and retry policy.
 *   5. Partial capture, partial refund and void: supported, and under what
 *      state constraints?
 *   6. ACH and wallet support, and whether settlement is synchronous.
 *   7. Sandbox availability and test card/account numbers.
