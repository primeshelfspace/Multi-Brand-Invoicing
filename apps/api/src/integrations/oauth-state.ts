 * The OAuth `state` parameter, self-verifying rather than looked up
 * server-side. A provider's redirect back to our callback is a fresh,
 * unauthenticated browser request — no session cookie can be relied on to
 * say which brand initiated this, or that this callback was not forged. HMAC
 * signing the brandId (and an issued-at bound to a short window) answers
 * both without a Redis key to manage and expire.
 *
 * Provider-neutral: Zoho Books and Stripe Connect both redirect through here.
 * The provider is part of the signed payload rather than assumed, so a state
 * minted for one provider's consent screen cannot be replayed against the
 * other's callback — connecting an accounting ledger and granting charge
 * access to a payment account have very different consequences, and sharing
 * one signing secret must not make the two interchangeable.
