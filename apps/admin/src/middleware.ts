 * FR-AUTH-021: no page of this app is reachable without a session.
 *
 * This is the cheap filter, not the access decision. It only asks whether a
 * session cookie is present — middleware runs on the edge runtime with no
 * database and no API round trip, so it cannot tell a live session from an
 * expired one. The real check is in (app)/layout.tsx, which asks the API, and
 * behind that the API's own guard, which is the only one that actually enforces
 * anything (hiding a page is not access control).
 *
 * What this does buy is that an unauthenticated request never renders a page or
 * spends a server round trip discovering it should not have.
